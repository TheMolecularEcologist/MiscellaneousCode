Welcome to the Molecular Ecologist Github repo!

We hope you find the code here to be useful; feel free to fork or clone the code here to use in your own research.

If you'd like to contribute code, there are several ways to do so:

• Email code to us at molecularecologist@gmail.com, along with a short writeup of what the code does and possibly some test files. We'll add it to the appropriate repo.

• If you have a file you'd like to contribute to one of our existing repos, fork it, make your changes, and send us a pull request. We can add it that way.

• If you have a Gist that you think others will find useful, send us a link.
